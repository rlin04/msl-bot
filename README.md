## Troubleshooting
### Script looping in airship or doing nothing.
#### Before troubleshooting for this problem:
  - Open Debug Input `Ctrl+D` and enter `getLocation()` to ensure  the following locations are being recognized:
    - `quests`, `monsters-astromon`, `manage`, `gem-upgrade`, `refill`, and `refill-confirm`
  - If the locations say 'unknown' on the log, proceed with the following troubleshooting.

---
**Using the RestartNox() function**: 

  - If you have the Nox emulator, you can open Debug Input `Ctrl+D` and enter `RestartNox()`. <br>
  - This function will close and open the Nox process with correct resolution, dpi, and language set. <br>
  - After restarting, try running a script. <br>
  - If the issue still occurs, continue with other methods.
  
**Using other Capture Mode**:

  - If `WinAPI` does not work for you, try switching to `ADB` or `None` capture mode.
  - If none of the modes work for you, ask help in Discord or create an issue report on Github.
